# Volunteer
You can volunteer your device in favor of Samsung community. \
Please contact me on Discord: `TheAirBlow#1917`

## Protocol Testing
We need people to test our Odin implementation, and also Mjolnir protocol if it would be present on newer devices.
To volunteer contact me on Discord mentioned above.

## Mjolnir Command Test
This would not do anything bad to your device in any way - it would send a `MJOLNIR` command to 
test if it exists. After that you can restart your device as if nothing happened.
To volunteer contact me on Discord mentioned above.
